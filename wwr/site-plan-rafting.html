        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>Our purpose is to offer as many people as possible the opportunity to enjoy thrilling water rafting experiences. We focus on combining fun and safety, creating an environment where experienced participants feel the excitement as if it were their first time, while guiding newcomers to understand and fully enjoy this exhilarating adventure.</p>
        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>We target young and adults, men and women, with all kind of routines but with one shared desire: to have an exciting, wild and stressless experience.</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Who are the target customers?</li>
                    <p>Our target customers consist of two groups: firstly, young individuals who love adventure and are always seeking new experiences; secondly, those in search of a chance to unwind in a natural environment, where they can temporarily set aside their responsibilities and alleviate stress.</p>
                <li>What do they expect to find or what questions will be answered by them accessing the website?</li>
                    <p>We want our potential customers to understand some basic things such as: Where can it be done? What is the pricing? When can it be done? What is the minimun age to participate? Should I go with my own group or could I go alone?</p>
                <li>What are their needs that aren't being met?</li>
                    <p>We understand that Guatemala has the resources to enjoy this type of sport. We want all of our customers to visit our website and understand that this activity is not always dangerous; it is a fun experience. We assure them that they will want to come back for more, equipped with the necessary knowledge. Consequently, we provide the necessary equipment, side-by-side training, transportation to the location, advance scheduling options, and a variety of locations so you can enjoy different experiences around the country.</p>
